Playing around with Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. So far, this has the SearchPage, but with very basic functionality and styling. You can refer to the Figma design (link found in the Discord and ReadMe of the project repo) to see how it should look.

To run this, you can right click on the index.html file, select "Copy Path," and paste that into the search bar of whatever browser you use. Or, you can right click and press "Open With Live Server."

I am adding detailed comments to this, feel free to play around with it! Remember, this is not where the project will be and is just a safe place outside of the actual project repo to get familiar with frontend development. I used online resources to quickly convert the React code for this component into vanilla JS and am going through and adding detailed notes. Let me know if you have any questions.
